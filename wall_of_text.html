		i am ready for more additional havings.
i would like to possess some further belongings, please.
additionally, if my having possession of a greater many objects were to occur,
yes and thank you, i would like to have more of them, please.

how to establish one's self
as an entity which exists?

not sure, are you?

can you stop? i am
not sure, are you?

the sky is so blue here
and i think that's it.
a vague time of day:
boundless, undefineable.
brunch, the elusive.
and  now i
and

and now i will sit in my room
and wait for myself to die.

that is what i am doing
that is what i am doing
that is what i am doingthat is what i am doing.

i will wait in my room
and    wait for my Self to die.


and now i will wait for the self to die.




and

why do i touch my face?
   because it is here.

and why is it here?
   do you have a choice?

do i have to live 
in this moment in particular?
   why should you exist
   in any other time?

   and other burning quesitons
i have for my self, while
i try to be different ways
in other places.

why do i love myself?
   because you are around.

the ice cream scooper was in the dish washer, so i just used a big spoon.
i felt that this was ok.
i treated it as i would an ice cream scooper, though i knew it was not.
i was fine, this was ok.

this was an excersice in resourcefulness.
i felt proud.
in the face of adversity, i did not falter.
i was calm.

i looked deep into a stark abyss today. unshaken,
i pressed on.
i felt the cold hand of darkness, i felt its breath.
i was still.

i feel something inside my chest,
some solid object in the center of my Self.
sometimes i feel it being pushed or pulled
by forces in the world around me.
i believe this object plays a crucial role
in the structural integrity 
of me.

congress could abolish the inevitable heat death of the universe with a simple majority. but they won’t. a simple majority. but they won’t. why would they? they could do it with a simple majority, but they won’t.

good one and very hilarious
i said to a friend sat beside me.

then i rose to my feet and the
room moved around me.

and i said to my friend
please and just stay beside me.

when the fuel light turns on, 
i come to regret
the great accelerations
of my younger self.

i love my computer
because it connects me 
to a world i want 
to be a part of
that i have created 
of parts
of other 
people's worlds

i'm glad i was born in ninety-five, a nice 
round number.

multiples of five, (are) less important only
than numbers that end in zero.

even numbers next,
that do not end in zero.

odd numbers aren't good,
unless they end in five.

ninety-five it suspensful: (because)
it implies one-hundred.

it's like a dream i had:

i went to school at the mall.
far enough from the food court
and across from Sunglasses Hut.
too far to smell the food court,
but close enough to walk
and yet

it was like a dream i had:

i was in a field with my brother,
we were walking towards the trees
	i turned the lights on and went searching
through the fridge. i found quite a bit of money
and stepped out and onto the street. 
i walked to the corner where a man was selling
sunglasses. i bought a pair, nearly 30
minutes to get there and we started running
to the trees.

its raining 
now 
again 
i think,
though sometimes i imagine 
things like rain.

i will pretend rain stands for 
some significant passage of time
when i am struggling to cope with 
the rate at which things change.

do i want time to stop 
or speed to a rate beyond perception?
as if to choose one 
would make it so.

its 2020, why
are we still juxtaposing?
i do want to watch you
compare and contrast,
i have an iphone.

just show me things.

that was the start of it,
but it’s true that lessons learned
are the least of my concern.
when did we first learn that
on the other side of the mountains
are more mountains?
i go to the tanning beds to meditate.
not concerned with what’s obscured,
i become golden.
certain things are unavoidable,
like how characters in popular TV shows
get hotter with each passing season.
but that was just the start of it
and from there we went on
and on and on and on.

i'm looking at so much shit
online just taking it all in like
damn look at all this shit
they got on here online like
damn i'm so in awe of all the shit
they got online these days like

damn, i love it, wow. there
are so many sites and pages.

i remember a mobile game from 2013
or 2014.

does anyone want to watch me spiral?
no one should have to watch me spiral.
i hope no one wants to watch me spiral.
it’s going to be cool as i spiral
don’t look at me as i spiral.

i am remembering a culturally relevant mobile game from 2013 or 2014 which
was before i realized i would hate the things i love and
now i realize i will come to hate the things i love always.
why should i be made to feel
even by myself?

and so i will spiral
and think about mobile games
and hide from view.

pay attention to the sky tonight,
as the sun goes down.

while the blue above you 
goes from light to dark,
think of all the places
we've been.

i'll be thinking too
of those lakes and rivers
and oceans, we've seen.

and, finally, at the point
when the sky's darkest blue
turns to black, do not fret:

it will happen again tomorrow.

this is now just sketches to me.
is this now what it always was?
or is it now
what it never was,
but wanted to be?

i am now no longer Cowboy;
will i ever see the mall again?

someone brought their dog in here;
if i can introduce chaos
am i not God?

i will have a pizza
again someday. again
someday i will eat
a pizza. so warm
this pizza, so
warm it will be. i
will comsume

it (the pizza)
with a passion. a
passion with which
few pizzas have
been eaten before. i
can feel its warmth
now, the warmth of
the pizza. the 

pizza warms me
from beyond.

it was the beginning of what was to be
an alternate timeline in which things went a little differently.
it was the beginning of a new me and as well a new way for me to be me.
it was the end of what was once a reality in which i was unhappy.
it was the end of a time during which little went my way.
it was none of these things and yet it was all so real to me.

the power of the automobile
comes from my limited ability 
to process information
at higher rates of speed.

the power of the highway 
is its ability to induce 
a sense of clarity, but
if you look too closely
you'll notice something like moiré.

the clouds are moving
particularly fast this morning, 
which is nice.

you really ought to appreciate
the world as more than a still-life
on days like today.


there are so many ways
to be/have                   
   been                 
      and               
there are so many       
things                    
that i                   
      am                  
      and like or              
      hate                    
                             
      and so                  
     i                      
      ask:                   
     	                   
      am                   
     i different  ways   
     in        other places?

tulpa...


is it ok if i want to fuck my tulpa?
i wanted to create a tulpa
and so it did 

and i got to know my tulpa and hung out with them.
is it possible for me to become my tulpa?
i want to become them.

my tulpa exists only in my own mind i think,
fully realized
and yet i want to fuck them for that reason.

i want to fuck my tulpa 
because they are so much of what i want to be.

i want to be a tulpa so badly and its a feeling
i cant understand and so i want to fuck it.

would it better to be my own tulpa
or someone else's? can i be my own tulpa?

i think i have two headaches
at the same time.

this time was going to be different,
but it's not.
i was going to be different,
but i'm not.
i'm the same
and i haven't changed
and i'm not different
and i'm the same.

i think i have four or five headaches
at the same time.
i have another, overlapping
headache for each time
this has happened before.

all that's changed
are those ribbons in the sky
which have gone
from pink to blue.

why is the sky blue?


i used to think that the blue sky
had something to do with the ocean,
but i guess that 
that's not true.


lately, i have been taking notes 
about exactly how i feel
and the things i see around me.
sometimes a moment feels unique
and worth remembering and i think

if a moment can be made to last forever,
it may not matter what happens next.

as a child, i had a dream 
where i was drowning,
but, as i searched for the horizon,
i realized could not discern 
the sea from the sky

(and i drown)

moments are my obsession; 
they are all we have.
i was, therefore i am. 
will i always be?

we were taught that it doesn't take long 
for things to change. 
things have changed 
and they are changing always.

take tonight, for an example:
the sky will be a special shade of blue,
but for one moment only.

there is a certain blue 
i am looking for
but the changes happen fast.

i have noticed patterns 
in the notes 
that i have taken. 

what does it mean
when that very special blue 
finds you in many forms 
and in many places?

and then you told 
me why the sky is blue,
that it has something to do 
with solar radiation.

it causes me to wonder:
am i more than the light 
that reflects my image?
you can only visit the Website once a year.
when you visit the Website, it is very good.
you want to visit the Website more than once a year.
you have to be very careful about when you visit the Website.

when do you visit the Website?

when you go back to the Website, it remembers you.
what has the Website been doing?
the Website is different from the last time you visited it.

when will you visit the Website?

why do i touch my face?
because it is here.

am i more
than the light
that reflects
my image? 

i get the sense
that this body
is my only tool
against it,

so i ask myself:
am i different ways
in other places?

i am told
to focus
on right now's
moment;

am i devoting
enough attention
to each passing
second?

and why do i love my self?
is it because i am around?

yes, and

now i am searching only
for the white noise equivalent
of human connection.

to remain inert

untouched by human hands,
unmoved by human expression and

existing only
as yours.

you know how everyone
has a certain way
that they are?
