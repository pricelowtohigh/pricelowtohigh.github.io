My "personal" website that I created before becoming serious about learning to code. Uses only the basic fuctions of HTML.

I have started to rebuild it in React and plan to add additional functionality and styling. Would also like to add some fun user-customizable options such as a "sign-in" page that allows site visitors to write their name and permanently displays it on the page.
